In this repository we will develop our user interface

1. Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.
  To get Node.js, go to https://nodejs.org/en/
  
2. Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages
  To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.
  This Quick Start uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.
  To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window. 
  
3. Install the Angular CLI globally.
  To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  
4. You should choose a directory for clone project and clone rep into this directory

5. You should open project in IDE

6. For start UI you should write in command line/terminal:
    
    6.1 npm install
    
    6.2 npm run start:mock
    
    Then you can see a site on browser
    
    In app-router.module.ts you may see some urls.
